I am first-year graduate student at the [MIT Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/), advised by Professor [Dimitris Bertsimas](https://www.dbertsim.mit.edu/). 
I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Economics from Smith College. 
Before graduate school, I worked as a research fellow at MIT Blueprint Labs.
My research focuses on developing machine learning and optimization methodologies to assist healthcare decision-making.
